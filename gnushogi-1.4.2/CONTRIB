    Hiroshi Tsuda: some openings added to gnushogi.tbk

    Cameron Gregory has added the shogi rules to the xshogi manual pages.

    Ken'ichi Nakayama has created alternative bitmaps for
    promoted rook and promoted bishop. He claims that these
    icons are more readable for japanese people. The bitmaps
    are introduced using the --with-top-part-bitmaps option.

    Paul Reines has created a set of pieces with more chess-like
    graphics, so that it may easier to learn how to play shogi.
    These pieces can be chosen instead of the japanese pieces
    by using the -DWESTERN_BITMAPS options in the Makefile.
    The postscript file western_moves.ps shows the possible moves
    using these icons.
    [NOTE: this postscript file has since been removed.  The western
    bitmaps are now always available.]
