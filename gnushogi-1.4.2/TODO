Known bugs:

- some positions show problem in the evaluation algorithm
- minishogi repetition rule, different from standard shogi, is
  not implemented
- with no piece on board, computer generates invalid move

Target for v1.5:

- refactor dspwrappers into a driver-like structure
- integrate H.G.Muller's work on the xboard protocol on top of that
- deprecate xshogi in favor of xboard
- make minishogi a run-time option rather than a compile-time one,
  using the "variant" mechanism of the xboard protocol

Generic cleanups

- switch cli parsing to getopt
- hunt for extern's and prototypes spread all over the source
- use automake
- hunt for more hardcoded variant-specific constants
  - position of captured pieces in curses mode
  - compile with bound-checker
- add autosave mode to ease hunt for segfaults ?
- use 2D array for the board, get rid of the (i)nunmap stuff
- fixup build procedure to support parallel make runs
- investigate those preexisting "overflow in implicit constant
  conversion" warnings

Minishogi-related stuff

- minishogi patterns
- tune difficulty levels
- other tunings to investigate
  * PromotionZoneDistanceBonus
  * OPENING_HINT
- add minishogi stuff to the doc
- use valid minishogi moves in online help
