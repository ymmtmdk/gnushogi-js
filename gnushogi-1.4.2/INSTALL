Installation procedure for GNU Shogi
====================================

If you've never installed a software package using a configure script before,
please read (or skim) the file "INSTALL.generic" which gives general
information on using configure scripts.  This file contains information
specific to GNU shogi.

The basic procedure:
-------------------

1. Type 'configure --prefix=<where you want GNU shogi installed>'.  If you
   don't specify a prefix, it will be set to /usr/local.  There are a few GNU
   shogi-specific options you can use for this command; see below.

2. Type 'make' to create gnushogi, the binary book file gnushogi.bbk, and
   xshogi (the graphical interface to gnushogi).

3. Type 'make install' to copy the binary book file to the library
   destination directory and to copy the gnushogi executable to the
   binary destination directory.

4. OPTIONAL:
   Type 'make clean' to remove object files and binaries from destination
   source directory.


Configuration options specific to GNU shogi:
-------------------------------------------

These only affect xshogi.

  --with-top-part-bitmaps    Use top part of Kanji bitmaps only.

  --with-first-shogi-program=PROGNAME    
        Use PROGNAME as the first shogi program (default: gnushogi)

  --with-second-shogi-program=PROGNAME    
        Use PROGNAME as the second shogi program (default: gnushogi)

  --with-first-host=HOSTNAME    
        Use HOSTNAME as the machine on which the first shogi program 
        runs (default: localhost)

  --with-second-host=HOSTNAME    
        Use HOSTNAME as the machine on which the second shogi program 
        runs (default: localhost)

  --with-xshogi    
        Compile the xshogi graphical interface to GNU shogi (default: yes)

If you don't want to compile xshogi, do 
'configure <other options> --without-xshogi'


Other options:
-------------

In the gnushogi directory, the file 'opts.h' includes a number of options that
can be set to configure the evaluator, to set the debugging level, etc.  These
options will probably only be of interest to people who are hacking the source
code, with one exception: if you want to have your games automatically saved
on exit, #define LIST_ON_EXIT in this file.


Platforms GNU shogi is known to compile on:
------------------------------------------

Red Hat Linux 9.0
Sun Solaris 2.6

Information about attempted or successful ports to other platforms would be
appreciated.   If you submit such a report, please specify what you had to do
to get GNU shogi to compile and run successfully.
