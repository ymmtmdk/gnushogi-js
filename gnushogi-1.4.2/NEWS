GNU shogi news
--------------

Changes in version 1.4.2 (02/2014):

* XShogi is no longer included in the GNU Shogi source, it is
  available as a separate source archive.
* Fixes for edit mode:
  - fixed clobbering of board on invalid input
  - display a message on wrong input
* Fixed Curses mode display:
  - reversed column number for MiniShogi
  - clock and captures position for MiniShogi
  - refresh display after "switch" to get player names updated
  - layout fixes, notably when using only 80 columns
* Minor code cleanups.

Changes in version 1.4.1 (01/2014):

* Initial support for the MiniShogi variant, for now as a separate
  executable built using "./configure --enable-minishogi".
* Support for building without the curses UI.
* Preliminary win32 support: can be built on cygwin with gcc3, in the
  win32 directory.
* Build system enhancements.
* Bug fixes.

Changes in version 1.4.0 (03/2012):

* Main change is the license switch to GPL3.
* Project is now being maintained on a git repository.
* Bug fixes.

Changes in version 1.3.2 (07/2004):

  correctly on modern Linuxes.


Changes in version 1.3.1 (07/2001):

* New piece bitmaps for both westernized and Japanese piece sets, courtesy of
  Bernhard Maerz.


Changes in version 1.3 (07/1999):

* xshogi has been merged into the gnushogi source tree and build process.

* gnushogi is now only one executable, instead of three (one each for the raw
  text interface, the xshogi interface, and the curses interface).  The three
  interfaces are still there; you select between them using a command-line
  option: "gnushogi -C" for the curses interface, "gnushogi -R" for the raw
  text interface, and "gnushogi -X" or just "gnushogi" for the xshogi
  interface.  Making the xshogi interface the default makes it easier for
  xshogi to invoke gnushogi (translation: I couldn't be bothered figuring out
  why this was the case, so I just left it that way).

* The gnushogi and xshogi source code has been thoroughly cleaned up and
  ANSIfied.  Several files have been renamed.  Makefiles have also been
  cleaned up considerably, but you don't need to care about this, because... 

* Building GNU shogi and xshogi now uses a configure script generated by
  autoconf.  This should increase portability and make compilation much
  easier. 

* There is now fairly extensive documentation in texinfo form, which has been
  used to generate info, postscript, and html versions of the documentation.
  The man page is included in the texinfo file.  The (separate) man pages have
  been updated to deal with the new command-line options for gnushogi.


This file starts with GNU Shogi 1.3 (07/01/1999).
